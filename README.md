## inkwhip 
a place to whip pen across paper.. metaphorically speaking.

Following a blog series written by Aaron Klaser (https://hackernoon.com/building-a-website-with-react-and-bulma-d655214bff2a)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Folder Structure

All components required by a page go to itâ€™s node folder. 
If the component is required by more than one components, like a branded button, then it goes to the src.components folder. 

End result should kind of resemble JSON structure.
